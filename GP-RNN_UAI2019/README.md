Latent dynamics discovery is challenging in extracting complex dynamics from high dimensional noisy neural data. we propose a novel latent dynamic model that is capable of capturing nonlinear, non-Markovian, long-short term time-dependent dynamics via recurrent neural networks and tackling complex nonlinear embedding via non-parametric Gaussian process. The model can be easily adapted to exploring latent representations of time series with either Gaussian (continuous) or Poisson (discrete) observations.

## 1. Model overview
### Model
Our model composes RNN (e.g.LSTM) with hidden states (**v**) encoded in the prior distribution of latent states (**z**), and then maps to the noisy-free space of observations (**x**).

###  Inference
The inference methods are non-trivial with Gaussian and Poisson observations, one of powerful inference networks is bi-LSTM as shown below, please see the details in the paper.
